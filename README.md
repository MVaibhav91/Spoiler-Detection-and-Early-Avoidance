Maintaining suspense is crucial for captivating audiences in a story. Prematurely revealing plot twists, climaxes, or endings can eliminate suspense, impairing audi ence enjoyment. Such critical information is commonly referred to as spoilers in
the realm of fiction. With the prevalence of the internet and smartphones, avoiding
spoilers posted on popular social networks has become increasingly challenging.
The objective of this study is to develop an effective machine learning model that
can detect spoilers in text. One of the primary challenges in spoiler detection is extracting relevant features that accurately represent the concept of text. To address
this challenge, our proposed approach incorporates syntactically related word pairs
alongside the traditional bag-of-words representation in the feature extraction technique.
Freedom of speech on virtual communities where film fanatics meet, can be a source of dread as user-generated data comes to be challenging for moderation.
However, this novelty way of synergy between these virtual communities comes
with a downside. Whenever these movie followers come across with online commentaries that contain pieces of information that are relevant to the film plot. These
type of content is well-known as spoilers. This project will focus on detection of
such a spoilers using ML approach.
